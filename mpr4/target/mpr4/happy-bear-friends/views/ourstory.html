            <p>Happy Bear Friends consists of two avid animal and plushie lovers, Kayen Fong and Ney Congjuico, who wanted to turn
            their passion for rare animals into a business while also spreading a message. There are many animals out there that not
            a lot of people know about still, and it is HBF's goal to educate the public and spread awareness of these animals in 
            order to help keep them from going extinct. </p>

            <h3>About our Products</h3>
            Our products are made from either high quality synthetic Cotton or Plush Felt Fabric and made with love by our master
            craftsmen and craftswomen. It takes a couple of days to weeks to craft our masterpieces as we pay close attention to detail,
            but we try our best to create and deliver only the highest quality life-like plush toys we can.

            <h3>Mission & Goal</h3>
            <p>Thirty percent of every plushie purchase goes to WWF (World Wildlife Fund). They are the world's leading conservation
            organization, working in 100 countries and supported by more than one million members in the United States and close to
            five million globally. Happy Bear Friends vows to contribute to the preservation of these animals by offering a percentage
            of our profits for the fund.</p>
